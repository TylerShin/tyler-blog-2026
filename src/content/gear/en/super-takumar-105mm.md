After using the Super Takumar 50mm F1.4 and falling in love with its unique color rendering, I wanted to get my hands on another one. Luckily, I found a listing in great condition and picked it up immediately.

When I first used a manual lens, I was surprised by how easy it was to handle and how satisfying it felt to manually focus on the subject. I really wanted to add one to my collection, and I’m so happy I did. Since I hadn't bought a telephoto zoom lens yet, this 105mm medium telephoto focal length was perfect for me.

If you look closely, you can see the amber coating on the lens. (It’s hard to see in the photo because my house is a bit dark, but I’ll try to capture it better in natural light next time.)

That amber color comes from a coating containing radioactive materials like thorium oxide. So, be careful not to clean it with just any lens cleaner, as it might strip the coating!

Naturally, vintage lenses don’t mount directly onto modern Sony bodies, so you need an adapter for "hybridization." I purchased a K&F Concept M42-NEX (E-mount) adapter.

Because of the adapter, the lens protrudes quite a bit from the body. It’s a telephoto lens, so it’s expected, but compared to how compact and cute the 50mm looked, it is a slight shame.

This is the original size. The adapter takes up quite a bit of space, roughly 20% of the total lens length.

This is what it looks like from above when shooting. The focus ring turns nearly three full rotations, allowing for very fine adjustments. You have to take your time to shoot, which makes the process feel more deliberate and thoughtful.

This is the aperture and focus control section. Even though I bought it used, there are barely any scratches, and the condition is excellent. I’m very satisfied.

Modern mirrorless cameras come equipped with "Focus Peaking," so manually focusing isn't as difficult as you might think. personally, I use Focus Peaking and have assigned the "Focus Magnifier" function to the AEL button on my Sony body to achieve precise focus.

### Sample Photos

*It produces a very warm tone in daylight.*

*They say the flare is artistic, but my skills are still lacking, so I haven't been able to capture it properly yet. 😢*

![Sample 3](/gear/super-takumar-105mm/8.jpg)
*At night, you can see beautiful, soft bokeh.*

![Sample 4](/gear/super-takumar-105mm/9.jpg)
*It's not a perfect circle, but closer to a lemon-shaped bokeh.*

![Sample 5](/gear/super-takumar-105mm/10.jpg)
*I am more than satisfied with these results.*

*If you stop down the aperture during sunset, you can capture beautiful sunstars like this.*

Shooting with a manual lens, stitching every shot together by hand, might seem inconvenient to some. However, the "tactile feel" is undeniable. After using it for a day, you start to get a feel for how much to turn the ring to get focus, and your shooting speed actually improves. (Of course, if you don't use it for a few days, you lose that touch immediately lol.)

Why not try slowing down and savoring the moment between you and your subject with a manual lens?
