This is the kind of article every React learner should read at least once.
The most useful parts are `Make It Hydration-Proof`, `Make It Composition-Proof`, and `Make It Portal-Proof`.

Most teams focus on shipping behavior first, but this post reframes component work around boundaries and failure modes. That framing is practical.
